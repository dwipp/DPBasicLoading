# DPSimpleLoading

It's a very basic loading in iOS. And absolutely it's a very lightweight library.
Inspired from progress loading in App Store.

## Usage

``` swift
// Initialize a progress loading for UITableView.
let loading = DPSimpleLoading(table: table_view)

// Initialize a progress loading for UICollectionView.
let loading = DPSimpleLoading(collection: collection_view)

// start the progress loading by putting loading message.
loading.startLoading("Loading...")

// end the progress loading.
loading.endLoading()
```

## Sample

Will be here soon!

## Installation

Manual installation. Just copy DPSimpleLoading folder to your project.
Will be available on cocoapods soon.

## Thanks To
